# UwpDevTidy
A tool to remove UWP apps created and installed during development.

If you create a lot of separate apps as part of development, debugging, and testing then you might end up with a lot of project folders on your machine.  
Deleting folders is easy but manually uninstalling a lot of apps can be slow. That's were this tool comes in. (Or rather it will when it's finished.)
It makes it quick and easy to uninstall lots of apps sideloaded in developer mode.
